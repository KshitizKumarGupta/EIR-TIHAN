# GUI for Data Annotations

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the GUI for Data Annotations project! This intuitive platform offers a powerful graphical user interface (GUI) designed to streamline the process of annotating images, performing object detection through a YOLO model, and enhancing your data labeling tasks using the LabelImg tool.

In the following sections, we'll guide you through the installation, setup, and optimal utilization of the Data Annotation platform. Whether you're an AI researcher, developer, or enthusiast, this documentation will equip you to leverage the project's capabilities effectively.

Let's embark on this journey of transforming raw data into a refined and annotated dataset, laying the foundation for robust machine learning models.

### Introduction
In the project lifecycle, Inference Phase-1 involves preparing the data and setting up the model, followed by the training phase where the model learns from the data, and finally, the Inference phase-2 stage where the trained model makes predictions or classifications based on new input.

### Inference Phase-1
This initial phase focuses on preparing the necessary data and setting up the machine learning model for training. Data preparation involves tasks such as cleaning, formatting, and organizing the data to make it suitable for the model. Using the training GUI labels are generated for the dataset.

### Training 
The generated labels from the Inference Phase-1 is the input to the training phase. In this phase, the prepared model is exposed to the training data to learn patterns and relationships. The model iteratively adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes in the training data. The training phase continues until the model reaches a satisfactory level of performance.

### Inference Phase-2
The output of training phase is the Inference result.
After the model has been trained, it moves to the inference phase, where it is applied to new, unseen data. In this phase, the trained model makes predictions or classifications based on input it hasn't encountered before. The model uses the knowledge gained during training to generalize and provide meaningful outputs for new data.
